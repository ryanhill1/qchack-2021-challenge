For our project we adapted, modified, and refactored non-optimal functionality from the [quantum_decomp](https://github.com/fedimser/quantum_decomp) open-source library. This library approximately implements the two-level decomposition procedures specified in [1] via a modulare, object-oriented approach. Its implementation decomposes a unitary through creation and manipulation of global gate objects using external scripts. Their procedure contains bugs, and when it executes, produces non-optimal solutions. We adapted stand-alone functions from their procedure to more closely implement [1] in a scripted approach that depends only on the NumPy and Math libaries. We then completely reworked conversion of the resulting two-level decomposition to cirq in a way that vastly reduces the number of CNOT gates and ultimately gives a near-optimal solution in the form of quantum operations. Our project represents a comprehensive refactorization and optimization (and debug) of selected functionality from the quantum_decomp code base, along with orignial matrix to quantum circuit translation in cirq.
